Title - Airbag Deployment Alert System Using CAN and GPS

Desciption of code - 

An innovative Airbag Deployment Alert System designed to enhance vehicle safety through the fusion of Controller Area Network (CAN) communication and Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. The system utilizes an ESP board in conjunction with an impact sensor to detect collisions accurately. Upon collision detection, the system triggers the rapid deployment of airbags to mitigate potential injuries to vehicle occupants. Simultaneously, the integrated GPS module transmits the vehicle's precise location to emergency responders, enabling swift and targeted assistance. By leveraging CAN for internal communication and GPS for external coordination, this system ensures efficient and reliable transmission of critical data in emergency situations. The seamless integration of CAN and GPS technology offers a robust solution for improving emergency response and reducing the severity of accidents on roadways.
